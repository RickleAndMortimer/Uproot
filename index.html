		        <hr />
			      <h4>We are three seniors attending different high schools but hang out before Covid-19 and voice call playing video games for hours straight during our free time. Outside of our common interests, we all had a different focus in our future careers, computer science, arts, and business.</p>
			     <hr /> 
				  <h4>Making LinkedIn accounts in search of meaningful opportunities from internships to part-time jobs to build up our work experience in our resumes and help pay for college. The LinkedIn listings in providing were limited in low requirement opportunities that a teenager would be able to do, specifically for high school students. We also noticed that early job search opportunities were in the eighteen to twenties age range, so we decided to broaden our search engine to anyone looking for their first job.</p>
		      	<hr />  
				  <h4>Our goal is to make a tool for new job finders to go from learning about jobs to being able to find one. Whether you are a sneaker salesperson, a struggling artist, or a basement programmer, like us, you need to learn financial literacy and be able to find a job.</p>
