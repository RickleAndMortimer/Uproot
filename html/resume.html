		<h1>Resume and LinkedIn<h1>
			
		<hr />
			
			<h2></h2>
			<p>Should look plain with little to no visuals on a resume to get through companies' applicant tracking system (ATS). Many applicants' resumes do not reach a human as they fail to get through the robots that cannot even read your resume.</p>
			<p>Try to quantify things as they can be easier to see by recruiters.</p>
			<p>Be concise and only list things that would make your resume look better.</p>
			<p>Update LinkedIn and connect with people by writing in the note of how you are interested in their experience in certain fields so you have more meaningful connections.</p>
			<p>If looking for a job, enable #OpenToWork so it shows on your profile picture.</p>
